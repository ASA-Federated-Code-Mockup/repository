### Federated Repository for Speech Research
#### Acoustical Society of America

---

The increasing proliferation of code, scripts, and programming language libraries for use in phonetic and speech science research raises concerns over the maintenance and organization of this disparate code base. These concerns have motivated us to explore the development a federated code repository under the umbrella of the Acoustical Society of America. Our primary goal for this repository is to serve as a central point from which researchers in the speech sciences can access code and data from the community that adheres to a set of established standards for documentation. The code will also be reviewed by other researchers for errors, vulnerabilities, and algorithmic misspecifications. Further, this repository will serve as a starting point for the future development of parallel libraries in open-source languages like R, Python, and Julia. This repository is the home for code submission, code review, documentation standards, open source data, educational resources, and experiment files.
